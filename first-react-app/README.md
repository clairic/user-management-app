# Simple Website to Add Users to a List  
In this project, I will create a basic web app where you will be able to add users to a list and they will be saved in a SQL database. 

## To-do List
- `Create the demo web app` âœ… 
- `Make it a bit less ugly` 
- `Connect the web app to an SQL database` 
- `Use the database to save the users' names` 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. 

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
